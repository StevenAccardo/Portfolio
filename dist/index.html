JavaScript/UI Developer position.</h5> <p> I was hired on by AASKI Technology, a private company that contracts for the U.S. government and private sector in many areas. The team I was hired on with worked specifically on a system that was used to transmit data via satellite connections from reconnasaince aircraft that were supporting military operations in the middle east. This system had a UI for controlling and monitoring the system details. All of the team members were C++, Python, network, satellite, manufacturing, and/or database engineers. There was no one who knew the client-side web development stack. When the system was created they had outsourced the building of the UI to a private company, and no longer received support from that company. So they decided to hire a JavaScript/UI developer, and I was selected. Coming in, there was ZERO understanding of the UI by the other team members, and no documentation left from the original company. So I was given a black box, was told to figure it out, and to start fixing the list of issues. So they pretty much threw me in the deep end and told me to swim. </p> <p> So, that is what I did. It was a large UI with many different views. At first, it was pretty daunting. I had to learn the entire flow of the system, not just the UI portion, but the backend and some hardware as well. Then I had to learn how these other systems were interacting with and depending on the UI. From there it was time to take a deep dive into my portion of the code. The development company had built the UI using Backbone.js and Marionette.js, which up until that point, I had only barely heard of backbone, so it looks like I was going to be learning a couple of frameworks. I began learning about backbone and Marionette, as well as pouring through all of the JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python files. Long story short, I got to the point where I had an intimate understanding of the UI and its underlying file structure. I mapped out, and documented, the dependancies and data flow for all of the JavaScript files. I was able to fix all of the UI issues as well as implement new features that the team had been wanting. In addition, I started working on some R&amp;D projects for new clients that ended up being the most dynamic and flashy portions of the UI. </p> <p> In the end, what I really would like you to take away from this, is not what languages or tech stacks I can work in. All of those can be learned with a bit of focus and tenacity, but rather the circumstances I was placed in, and how I still managed to excel in the position. I was a junior developer, who was self taught, stepping in to fill a role without any senior web devlopers to turn to for help or guidance. I mapped out, repaired, and added onto a code base that was designed and implemented by a professional company. I still have that same drive, but with an even stronger understanding of the languages and tech stacks! </p> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-6 mb-3 mb-md-0"> <div class="rounded course-list-container p-3"> <button class="btn course-button w-100 mb-md-3" type=button data-toggle=collapse data-target=#course-list aria-expanded=false aria-controls=course-list> Click here to see the list of courses I have taken!

Unfortunately, after graduating I quickly learned that there were very little jobs available in that field. You pretty much needed a PhD to work in the bigger labs. Due to my initiative, I was one of the only students from my graduating class to secure a position in that industry. I ended up being hired at a nanotech company, but at the end of the day, the field didn’t hold my interest, and wasn’t on par with what I expected from an engineering degree, economically. So I gave my notice and walked away from the field. Prior to learning about the NanoEngineering program, I was planning to pursue software engineering as my major. There is so much to learn when it comes to programming, and I enjoy an industry that allows me to constantly grow and build on what I have learned. I also really enjoy the mini triumphs that come from problem solving. So I decided to make the switch! </div> <div class="tab-pane fade" id=list-question2 role=tabpanel aria-labelledby=list-question2-list> A: I loved working as a developer! The short answer is that, I got greedy and restless. I was working as a JavaScript/UI Developer, but during that time I had broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years. At the same time a friend of mine was working as a sales manager in the mortgage industry, and was making a lot of money doing it. He was a former engineer as well. So I thought to myself, “Hey! you can do this too!” So I gave a 30-day notice to my company, sold all of my stuff, and moved up to Orange County. It turned out that working in the mortgage industry full-time didn't fit me for a few reasons. It was a mistake on my part, but I’m glad that I had the chance to try another field, so I could realize how much I loved working as a developer. So here I am, back to what I enjoy doing! </div> <div class="tab-pane fade" id=list-question3 role=tabpanel aria-labelledby=list-question3-list> A: I knew that I was going to be getting back into development, and I had made enough income in the mortgage industry to hold me over. I'm the type of person where if I've made up my mind to do something, I commit to it fully. So with that, I gave my notice and decided to pour myself into preparing. So for the last few months I have been brushing up on my skill set as well as adding to it. I’ve also had to make new example applications to showcase my skill set, which takes time to put together. So, I have been creating and learning on a daily basis since before I left the mortgage industry. </div> </div> </div> <h5 class="last-resume mb-3">If you haven't had a chance to look over my r&eacute;sum&eacute;, you can view it <a class=resume-link href=./Steven_Accardo_Resume.pdf target=_blank>here</a>.</h5> <h5 class=goodbye>Thanks for stopping by!
